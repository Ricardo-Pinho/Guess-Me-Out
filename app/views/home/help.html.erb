			<a id="what">What is Guess Me Out? Who are you?</a>
			<p>GMO is a game developed for Android&trade;. Development started in September 2012 for the Software Development Labs subject in University of Porto, Faculty of Engineering. As of the writing of this, we are a team of 7 students working to keep the project from falling apart.</p>

			<a id="start">I'm ready to play. How do I get started?</a>
			<p>There should be an icon on the top of this page that links to the page of our app on Google Play. The first thing you need to do is install our app, then create a new account and finally run the app and look for people playing nearby. You can also play with anyone in the world if you happen to be the only one around that plays it.</p>

				Please feel free to use the avatar you created on the web as long as you don't:
				<ul>
					<li>Alter the avatar;</li>
					<li>Publish it as your own (always link back to us when possible);</li>
					<li>Use the avatar or our name in anyway that creates a sense of endorsement from our part, unless otherwise allowed by us.</li>
				</ul>
